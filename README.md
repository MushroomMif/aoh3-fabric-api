AOH3 Fabric Api
====
This mod adds a lot of useful APIs, that can be used by developers of other mods,
such as a resource loader, event system and powerful file modification API.
You can read more about it at the 
[Documentation page](https://github.com/MushroomMif/aoh3-fabric-api/blob/master/DOCS.md).
Also, it adds some minor tweaks to the game to enhance use of the AOH3 Fabric
Loader with it

# How to install it
Install the [AOH3 Fabric Loader](https://github.com/MushroomMif/aoh3-fabric-loader)
if you haven't already and then just download an `aoh3-fabric-api.jar` file from
[a latest release](https://github.com/MushroomMif/aoh3-fabric-api/releases/latest)
and put it to your `mods` directory

# How to use it in mod development
Download `aoh3-fabric-api.jar` and `aoh3-fabric-api-sources.jar` files from
[a latest release](https://github.com/MushroomMif/aoh3-fabric-api/releases/latest)
and add them to dependencies of your project. AOH3 Fabric Api is already added in
[the example mod](https://github.com/MushroomMif/example-aoh3-fabric-mod) 
by the way
